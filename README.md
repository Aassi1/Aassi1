# Hey, I'm Assi 👋

## What I'm Working On Right Now

**Performance Optimization System** -  Full-stack app using React/TypeScript, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, and PyTorch. Doubles as my final project for two classes (database management + neural networks).

## Things I've Built

**ASL Translation System** - Real-time sign language recognition using computer vision. Trained on 78,000+ images with MediaPipe and PyTorch. Built this because accessibility tech is cool and challenging.

**Deepfake Detection** - CNN-based detector that tells you if a face is real or AI-generated. 96.73% precision on 391K images using EfficientNet. 

**RFP Automation Prototypes** - Current internship work at Gatestone. Building AI tools for enterprise document processing using RAG, vector embeddings, and LLMs (OpenAI/Claude APIs).

**Call Analysis Tool** - NLP system that analyzes customer service calls using Deepgram API. Automated scoring for agent performance.

## Stack I Use

**AI/ML stuff:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, OpenCV, MediaPipe, Hugging Face, RAG systems

**Languages:** These are presented in "most comfortable" order :  Python, C++, SQL, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java C, Ruby

**Web/Backend:** React, FastAPI, Flask, Qt, PostgreSQL, Docker

**Cloud:** AWS, OpenAI API, Claude API, Deepgram API

Currently aiming for Summer 2026 internships in ML/AI engineering.
